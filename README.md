## About

This project was done during the "Current Trends in Gaming DIT468" course. The intention was to explore the VR medium and try to create a game that uses VR medium strengths. **The game was made with Unity and coded in C# (.NET), the game's targeted VR platform is Meta Quest 2.** "SpoolGun" is a prototype, main and all updated implementation has been done in "VRSpoolGun". (Sadly the game doesn't have any audio)

This is a VR Game where the user can choose a different thread, each thread has a different effect. the player's goal is to kill all incoming enemies attacking your base and giude your allies to gather resources so you can keep shooting threads to disrupt and kill enemies or help your allies.

## My contribution

I was responsible for creating pathfinding for the units (both enemies and allies), I was also responsible for the level design of the game. I made the sewing needle model used in the game, the model was created in Blender.
