# Thread Gun

This project was done during the "Current Trends in Gaming DIT468" course. The intention was to explore the VR medium and try to create a game that uses VR medium strengths. (Sadly the game doesn't have any audio)

This is a VR Game where the user can choose a different thread, each thread has a different effect. "SpoolGun" is a prototype, main and all updated implementation has been done in "VRSpoolGun".
